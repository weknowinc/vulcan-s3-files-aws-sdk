# Vulcan S3 Files Example

This is an alternative to upload images to amazon s3, based on [Vulcan Files](https://github.com/OrigenStudio/vulcan-files) implmenting the library [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk)

The Vulcan Files project is outdated with the current version of Vulcan.js and is not currently working.

## Quick Install

If you already have Meteor up and running, read this section. Otherwise, read the [Complete Install](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan-Starter#complete-install) section of Vulcan Starter docs.

#### Step 1 - Clone

```
git clone git@github.com:harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files.git
cd example-vulcan-s3-files
```

(or, using `https`: `git clone https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files.git`)

#### AWS Credentials
Before starting to run the project, you must have a settings file in `.deploy/settings.dev.json` with the following infomation:

```
{
  "amazonAWSS3": {
    "mainBucket": {
      "client": {
        "key": "*************",
        "secret": "************",
        "region": "************",
        "bucket": "************"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 2 â€“ Run
```
meteor npm install
meteor npm start
```

## How works

In order to create this implementation function, I have to introduce some changes listed below.

* Implemented the library [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) that enable us to upload files easily, in a collection to save files/images. [See implementation](https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files/blob/master/packages/vulcan-s3-files/lib/modules/singlePic/FSCollection.js#L25)
* Used the `react-dropzone@8.2.0` version.
* Used the `react-apollo` on client to make a query if the item is being edited because the fragment doesn't work on editForm [Vulcan Issue](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Vulcan/issues/2277). [See implementation](https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files/blob/master/packages/vulcan-s3-files/lib/components/Uploadcomponent/Upload.jsx#L229)
* Implemented a callback/listener to s3 files/images collection to delete an imagen when the item is being deleted. [See implementation](https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files/blob/master/packages/vulcan-s3-files/lib/modules/callbacks.js)
* Create a FSCollection that implements a collection of `meteor/ostrio:files` to storage the files. [See implementation](https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files/blob/master/packages/vulcan-s3-files/lib/modules/singlePic/FSCollection.js)
* Create a service that has the methods to upload and delete files when the item is being created or updated. [See implementation](https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files/blob/master/packages/vulcan-s3-files/lib/utils/s3Service.js)
* Define the schema that contains the upload with the options property that contains a object with Collection Name, FS Collection and the collection where the document is stored. [See implementation](https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files/blob/master/packages/vulcan-s3-files/lib/modules/singlePic/schema.js#L53)
* Refactor the upload component to work properly.[See implementation](https://github.com/harold20/example-vulcan-s3-files/blob/master/packages/vulcan-s3-files/lib/components/Uploadcomponent/Upload.jsx)

### Next steps
* Figure out how resolve a field as an array.
